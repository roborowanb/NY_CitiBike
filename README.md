# NY_CitiBike

## Overview
They say luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity. Well it is no different for our scenario with Kate when an angel investor materializes an opportunity for us to start a bike sharing company. We will need to provide a solid business plan with insights on the organization and success of the NY CitiBike operation. Weâ€™ve downloaded data from August 2019 and used Tableau [(Click here for Tableau Visuals)](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/rowan.backhouse/viz/CitiBikeUsage_16605067390640/CitiBikeUsage?publish=yes) to visualize the key drivers that we hope to leverage in our hometown of Des Moines, Iowa.


## Results
### Commuter Traffic Trends to Optimize Bike Locations
As seen in our Tableau dashboard, bike sharing is used a lot for commuting. We should be aware of where to store bikes at the beggining of the day vs the end of the day so that we can maximuze the utility of every bike in inventory. In the visual below, we see that during the begginging of the day, the start stations are more likely to be outside of the city and in manhattan. But at the end of the day, the reverse is true. We will have to ensure there are more bikes available outside the city center in the morning, and less in the evening so that there are availble slots for commuters returning home. 

### Understanding Sales Demographic to Target Market
On the Trips tab we notice a few things. One being that most revenue is from the subscriber base as opposed to the per use customers. Interestingly, males dominate the sales brought in from both customers and subscribers. Another thing to notice is that weekday trips are usually taken during commuting hours, while on weekends, they gravitate to the middle of the day, presumably as leisure. All this information allows us to understand who we are selling to in order to build our product delivery in a fashion that will suit their needs most.  

### Evaluating Use Cases to Make Sound Investment in Equipment
Finally, if we navigate to the Checkout Times tab, we see that a large majority of trips last fewer than 20 minutes. And once again, we see that most of these trips are taken by males. When deciding what bikes to purchase for our inventory, we will need to have bikes reliable enough to endure these sorts of trips. 


## Summary
Strike while the irons hot. Do not let this opportunity to better your home town with green, reliable, cost efficient infrastructure.
